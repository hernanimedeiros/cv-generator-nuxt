# cv-generator-nuxt
A CV generator app written in Nuxt.
In dev environment everything worked like a charm but when I deployed it on Netlify some components broken... I will revisited this app in future...

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
